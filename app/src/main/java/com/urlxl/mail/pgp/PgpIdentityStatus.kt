 * Whether the currently paired account has a PGP identity configured on the server.
 *
 * There is no device-reachable "just tell me yes/no" endpoint for this: `GET /api/pgp/identity`
 * (kypost-server's actual identity-status endpoint) is registered `withAuth` — web-session-cookie
 * only, per `backend/internal/api/server.go` — so a paired mobile device, which authenticates with
 * X-Kypost-Device-Id/X-Kypost-Device-Secret headers and has no session cookie (see
 * [PgpQrClient]'s own doc comment), can't call it. Minting a PGP QR token
 * (`GET /api/pgp/qr/token`, `withMailAuth` — reachable from a paired device) already distinguishes
 * "has an identity" (200) from "doesn't" (400 → [PgpQrTokenResult.NoIdentity]) as a side effect of
 * its real job, and [PgpKeyActivity] already relies on exactly that distinction to decide what to
 * show on its own-QR screen — this reuses the same signal rather than adding a second,
 * device-unreachable way to ask the same question.
 *
 * Returns `null` (not "no") when the account isn't paired or the check fails for any other reason,
 * so callers don't have to treat "couldn't check" the same as a confirmed "no identity".
